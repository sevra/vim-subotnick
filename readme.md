# Subotnic Color Scheme
## About
Subotnic is a dark color scheme for vim and gvim. It was created to be a readable in both high and low light settings. I picked colors which I believe go together well, though I am no designer. I feel that colors should help convey the meaning of the code without distracting the programmer.
